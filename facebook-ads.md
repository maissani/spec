## 1. Introduction

The Facebook Ads marketing connector will facilitate the automated extraction of ad performance data from Facebook Ads. The connector will authenticate with Facebookâ€™s API, retrieve relevant data, process it, and integrate it into the client's marketing and analytics platforms.

## 2. System Requirements

- **Operating System:** Linux, Windows, or macOS
- **Programming Languages:** Python, Node.js, or Go
- **Tools:** Docker, Helm (for containerization and orchestration)
- **External APIs:** Facebook Marketing API

## 3. Design Specifications

### Authentication

**Functional Requirements:**
- Use OAuth 2.0 for secure authentication.
- Support token refresh to maintain long-term connectivity.
- Securely store and manage OAuth tokens.

**Non-Functional Requirements:**
- Ensure high security for authentication processes.
- Provide detailed logging for authentication events.

### Data Retrieval

**Functional Requirements:**
- Connect to Facebook Marketing API.
- Retrieve data on ad campaigns, ad sets, ads, and insights (e.g., impressions, clicks, conversions).
- Support configurable date ranges for data retrieval.
- Handle pagination for large datasets.

**Non-Functional Requirements:**
- Optimize API calls to minimize latency and resource consumption.
- Ensure data completeness and accuracy.

### Data Processing

**Functional Requirements:**
- Normalize and format retrieved data into a standardized schema.
- Perform necessary data transformations (e.g., aggregations, calculations).

**Non-Functional Requirements:**
- Maintain high performance and low latency in data processing.
- Ensure data integrity and consistency.

### Data Integration

**Functional Requirements:**
- Export processed data to target systems (e.g., databases, data warehouses, analytics platforms).
- Support various data destinations (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, Google BigQuery, AWS S3).

**Non-Functional Requirements:**
- Ensure reliable and efficient data transfer.
- Provide options for real-time and batch data integration.

## 4. Implementation Details

### Programming Languages

Choose one of the following languages based on the team's expertise and project requirements:

- **Python:** Rich libraries for API integration and data processing.
- **Node.js:** Event-driven, non-blocking I/O for handling asynchronous API calls.
- **Go:** High performance, concurrency, and efficiency.

### Libraries and Dependencies

For each language, use the following libraries to simplify development:

- **Python:** `requests`, `pandas`, `sqlalchemy`
- **Node.js:** `axios`, `node-fetch`, `pg`
- **Go:** `http`, `json`, `sql`

## 5. API Rate Limiting and Error Handling

- Implement retry mechanisms with exponential backoff for handling API rate limits.
- Handle common errors (e.g., authentication failures, network issues) gracefully.
- Log all errors and retries for monitoring and troubleshooting purposes.

## 6. Testing and Validation

- Unit tests for individual components (authentication, data retrieval, processing, integration).
- Integration tests to verify end-to-end data flow.
- Performance tests to measure efficiency and resource usage.
- User acceptance testing to ensure functionality meets business requirements.

## 7. Deployment

- Containerize the application using Docker.
- Use Helm for orchestration in Kubernetes environments.
- Provide deployment scripts and configuration files.

## 8. Security Considerations

- Encrypt sensitive data (e.g., OAuth tokens) at rest and in transit.
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC) for managing access to the connector.
- Regularly update dependencies to address security vulnerabilities.

## 9. Maintenance and Support

- Provide comprehensive documentation for installation, configuration, and usage.
- Establish a support plan for troubleshooting and updates.
- Monitor application performance and error logs for proactive maintenance.
