## 1. Introduction

UDP multicast allows the transmission of data to multiple receivers with a single send operation. This project involves creating a sender application that multicasts data packets to a designated multicast group and a receiver application that listens to this multicast group and processes the received data.

## 2. System Requirements

- **Operating System:** Linux (preferred), Windows, or macOS
- **Network:** Support for UDP and IP multicast
- **Programming Languages:** Rust, Go, or Python (as per developer preference)
- **Tools:** Docker, Helm (for containerization and orchestration)

## 3. Design Specifications

### Sender

**Functional Requirements:**
- Join a specific multicast group.
- Send data packets to the multicast group at regular intervals.
- Support for configurable multicast address and port.
- Option to specify the interface for multicast transmission.
- Graceful handling of termination signals (e.g., SIGINT, SIGTERM).

**Non-Functional Requirements:**
- High performance and low latency.
- Scalable to support large volumes of data.
- Minimal resource consumption.

### Receiver

**Functional Requirements:**
- Join a specific multicast group and port.
- Listen for incoming multicast packets.
- Process and display/log the received data.
- Support for configurable multicast address and port.
- Option to specify the interface for multicast reception.

**Non-Functional Requirements:**
- High performance and low latency.
- Ability to handle packet loss gracefully.
- Scalable to support multiple receivers.

## 4. Implementation Details

### Programming Languages

Choose one of the following languages based on the team's expertise and project requirements:

- **Rust:** High performance, memory safety, and concurrency support.
- **Go:** Simplicity, concurrency, and strong performance.
- **Python:** Ease of use, rapid development, and extensive libraries.

### Libraries and Dependencies

For each language, use the following libraries to simplify development:

- **Rust:** `tokio` for asynchronous networking, `mio` for I/O handling.
- **Go:** `net` package for networking.
- **Python:** `socket` and `struct` modules for networking and data handling.

## 5. Network Configuration

- **Multicast Address:** Use an address in the range 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255.
- **Port Number:** Choose an appropriate port number (e.g., 5000).
- **TTL (Time to Live):** Configure TTL to limit the multicast packet's network reach.
- **Interface:** Ensure the network interface supports multicast and is properly configured.

## 6. Error Handling and Logging

- Implement robust error handling to manage network failures, invalid configurations, and unexpected termination.
- Use logging libraries to record significant events, errors, and status updates.
  - **Rust:** `log` and `env_logger`.
  - **Go:** `log` package.
  - **Python:** `logging` module.

## 7. Testing and Validation

- Unit tests for individual components (sender and receiver).
- Integration tests to verify end-to-end multicast functionality.
- Performance tests to measure latency, throughput, and resource usage.
- Simulate network conditions to test resilience and error handling.

## 8. Deployment

- Containerize the sender and receiver applications using Docker.
- Use Helm for orchestration in Kubernetes environments.
- Provide deployment scripts and configuration files.

## 9. Security Considerations

- Validate and sanitize all inputs.
- Ensure multicast data integrity and authenticity.
- Implement access controls and restrict multicast group membership.

## 10. Maintenance and Support

- Provide comprehensive documentation for installation, configuration, and usage.
- Establish a support plan for troubleshooting and updates.
- Regularly update dependencies to address security vulnerabilities and performance improvements.
